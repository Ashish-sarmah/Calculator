# Calculator
This is a calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication on 32 bit integers. Basically, it is written in assembly language. I have used ARM Simluator that acts as a virtual ARM chip that runs on your computer. It allows ARM programs to run without any hardware. This program takes two numbers (32 bit) in the memory and performs addition , subtraction and multiplication of the two and stores back in the memory. You may even see the results in general purpose registers. If your result overflows 32 bits or can't be represented in 32 bits don't expect correct result.
Please refer code in arm.s file.
